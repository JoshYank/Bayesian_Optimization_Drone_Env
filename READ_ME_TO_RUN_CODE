Install Adversarial Testing and gym-pybullet-drone into same virtual environment.

To run Bayeisan Optimization for a policy, use the following code:
  run BO_Singleagent_February3.py --exp ./results/Name_of_Policy_Folder
  (i.e.)run BO_Singleagent_February3.py --exp ./results/save-hover-ppo-kin-vel-02.22.2022_14.53.33 (This is the policy being tested)
To see list of outputs, use this code
  TM_name.f_acqu.Y (for smooth)
To see list of corresponding environmental parameters, use:
  TM_name.smooth_X
The code is slightly different for random_sampling and ns_GP.

To run a simulation by hand, copy lines 105-140 of the test_singleagent.py file and change to wanted environmentall parameter. (Do this fter running the BO file)
   test_env.INIT_XYZS=[[0,0,0]]
    test_env.INIT_RPYS=[[0,0,0]]
This way, we can look at the trajectory the drone takes which is saved to the variable traj. We can also see what the safety output should be.
This safety value is stored in the variable Simulation_Results_Smooth.
